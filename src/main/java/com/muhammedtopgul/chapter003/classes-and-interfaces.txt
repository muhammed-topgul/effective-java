Item 15: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members.
         - Make each class or member as inaccessible as possible.
         - Instance fields of public classes should rarely be public.
         - Classes with public mutable fields are not generally thread-safe.
         - It is wrong for a class to have a public static final array field, or an accessor that returns such a field.

Item 16: In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields.
